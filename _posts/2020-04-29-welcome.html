<p>Hi, I’m Hailey!</p>
<p>I’m a <strong>software engineer</strong> studying Mathematics and Computing science at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC. I like finding patterns and solving challenging problems. I spend my free time writing codes, debugging them until they work, and hanging out with my nerdy friends.</p>
<p>Below is more about me!</p>
<hr>

<h2>Math & Computer Science</h2>
<br>
<p>I’m a third year undergraduate student majoring in <a href="http://www.sfu.ca/students/calendar/2020/summer/programs/mathematics-and-computing-science/joint-major/bachelor-of-science.html">Mathematics and Computing Science (a.k.a. MACM)</a>. MACM is a program for students who came to decide their major between (1) Mathematics and (2) Computing Science, and thought:</p>
<blockquote>“Why give up one? Let’s learn both!”</blockquote>
<p>Yes! I am a programmer with strong mathematical background, or in other direction, a mathematician with strong programming skills. I enjoy applying data structures and algorithms while solving programming problems. You can see my codes <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>My university goal is to be able to understand any math / computer related papers and articles I want to read myself. (Write some more here)</p>

<h2>My Projects</h2>
<br>
<h3><a href="special-fortification-unit-proposal">Special Fortification Unit</a></h3>
<br>
<p>Special Fortification Unit (S.F.U.) is a web-based, real-time, multiplayer survival
    game set at SFU Burnaby. </p>
<p>S.F.U. was my team project for CMPT 276: Intro to Software Engineering. It was developed in a team of 5 students following the Agile software development process - 
</p>

<h3><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}ColorQuirrel/">ColorQuirrel</a></h3>
<br>
<p>ColorQuirrel is a MATLAB image processing program that plays around color spaces. It converts the image to several different ways to represent the data, extracts the representative color from the image by clustering the data, and uses down-sampling method to speed up the procedure.</p>

<h3><a>Sapiens</a></h3>
<br>
<p>Sapiens is a human civilization simulator written in Javascript. (TODO: Write more)</p>

<h3>...and this blog!</h3>
<br>
<p>My blog is made with <strong>Jekyll</strong> using <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/jasper2/">Jasper2 Ghost theme</a>. You can find the repository for my blog (<em>before</em> Jekyll build) <a href="https://github.com/havocado/jekyll_blog_maker">here</a>.</p>
<p>Some changes made by me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prism is used for highlighting codes.</li>
    <li>Posts are sorted in custom priority (Important posts first!)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite Tools</h2>
<br>
<p>I mainly work with <strong style="color:orange">C++</strong> and <strong style="color:orange">Node.js</strong>. Those two are the languages I am most comfortable with.</p>
<p>I also have used:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Express.js, Socket.io</strong> for an academic project</li>
    <li><strong>MySQL</strong> with <strong>Workbench</strong> for an online course</li>
    <li><strong>MATLAB</strong> for a math course and an academic project</li>
</ul>
<p>I have used, but not yet fluent with:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Python3, Selenium, Openpyxl, WordCloud, Matplotlib</strong> for an online course</li>
    <li><strong>PostgreSQL</strong> for an academic project</li>
    <li><strong>Chart.js</strong> for a personal project</li>
    <li><strong>Jekyll, Ruby on Rails, Gulp</strong> for this blog</li>
</ul>
<p>For non-technical tools, I use:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>XMind</strong> for mind maps</li>
    <li><strong>Calendar+</strong> for time management</li>
    <li><strong>Trello</strong> for kanban task management</li>
</ul>
