<p><strong>This blog is not done. Come back later!</strong></p>

<p>Hi, I’m Hailey!</p>
<p>I’m a <strong>software engineer</strong> studying Mathematics and Computing science at Simon Fraser University, Vancouver, BC, Canada. I like finding patterns and solving challenging problems. I spend my free time writing codes, debugging them until they work, and hanging out with my nerdy friends.</p>
<p>Below is more about me!</p>
<hr>

<h2>Math & Computer Science</h2>
<br>
<p>I’m a third year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics and Computing Science (a.k.a. MACM). MACM is a program for students who came to decide their major between (1) Mathematics and (2) Computing Science, and thought:</p>
<blockquote>“Why give up one? Let’s learn both!”</blockquote>
<p>Yes! I am a programmer with strong mathematical background, or in other direction, a mathematician with strong programming skills. I like it.</p>
<p>My university goal is to be able to understand any math / computer related papers and articles I want to learn myself. I’m confident with my self-learning skills, but some things are better to learn in school – basic knowledge that won't change. I want to build up my cornerstone for math and programming in university, and I will build up the rest myself.</p>
